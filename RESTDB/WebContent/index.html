<h2>Total Inventory</h2>
<p>Two new packages have been added (inventory and util).  Inventory will allow you to manage computer parts in the PC_PARTS table. 
	In the util package, a ToJSON class has been added to convert database resultset into JSON array.
</p>
<p>
	One API resources was created in part 4: <br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v1/inventory">http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v1/inventory</a> - <em>This url will return all the rows PC_PARTS table.</em>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Inventory by brand </h2>

<p>
	Two of the API resources are for searching on the brand but but done differently:<br />
	The first one is by @QueryParam:<br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory?brand=nvidia">http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory?brand=nvidia</a> <br />
	The second one is by @PathParam:<br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory/nvidia">http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory/nvidia</a>
	<br /><br />
	
	The third api resource search by brand and item number using @PathParam:<br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory/nvidia/970">http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/api/v2/inventory/nvidia/970</a>
</p>

<h2>Posting to database</h2>
<p>Introducing the POST method, we will be using POST to insert into the PC PARTS database table.  There is going to be two examples. One using data binding (object mapping)
The other way (2) is the use JSONArrays and JSONObjects.  Both ways are valid, choose which one you want to go with.
</p>
<p>
	In order to demo POST, I have created a simple web form with a POST ajax request. <br />
	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/post.html">POST web form</a>

	<a href="http://localhost:8080/RESTDB/put.html">PUT web form</a>
	<br /><br />
	
	The link below is a demo of DELETE, this web form will allow you to delete a row from PC PARTS table. <br />
